# SamSpecCoEN
Build sample-specific co-expression networks.


Overview
========
The goal of this code is to build sample-specific co-expression networks: 
All samples have the same network *structure*, but edge weights depend on the sample.
The co-expression networks are built from Pearson's correlation between gene expressions.
Each individual weights reflects the sample's contribution/deviation from this population-wide correlation.

The two options are:  
1. LIONESS [Kuijjer et al., 2015]: For a given sample, an edge-weight is the contribution of this sample to the global correlation.  
2. For a given sample, the edge-weight is the distance of that sample to the regression line fitting the expression of both genes. This quantifies how much this sample deviates from the population-wide behaviour.  

We also use ideas from [Zhang and Horvath, 2005] to build the global (population-wide) network, i.e. that a co-expression network should be approximately scale-free.  

This code is meant to be used on the ACES gene expression data [Staiger et al., 2013].

Usage
=====
Creating sample-specific co-expression networks
-----------------------------------------------

The class for creating sample-specific co-expression neworks is `CoExpressionNetwork.py`. It can be used in the following manner:

### Networks for a single data set
```python CoExpressionNetwork.py DMFS outputs/U133A_combat_DMFS```
creates sample-specific coexpression networks for the entire dataset. The network structure (list of edges) is stored under `outputs/U122A_combat_DMFS/edges.gz` and its weights under `outputs/U122A_combat_DMFS/lioness/edges_weights.gz` (for the LIONESS approach) or `outputs/U122A_combat_DMFS/regline/edges_weights.gz` (for the regression line approach).

### Networks in a cross-validation setting
```python CoExpressionNetwork.py DMFS outputs/U133A_combat_DMFS -k 5```
creates 5 folds for cross-validation. The network structure (list of edges) is stored under `outputs/U122A_combat_DMFS/edges.gz` and its weights, for each fold from k=0 to k=4, under `outputs/U122A_combat_DMFS/<k>/lioness/edges_weights.gz` (for the LIONESS approach) or `outputs/U122A_combat_DMFS/<k>/regline/edges_weights.gz` (for the regression line approach). 

`outputs/U122A_combat_DMFS/<k>` also contains training and test indices and labels.

### Networks in a subtype-stratified cross-validation setting
In order to evaluate the expressiveness of the representation of samples by their sample-specific co-expression network, we use a subtype-stratified cross-validation setting similar to that described in [Allahyar & de Ridder, 2015].

To create the corresponding data folds and networks:
```
    for repeat in {0..9}
    do
        python setupSubtypeStratifiedCV_writeIndices.py data/SamSpecCoEN ${repeat}
    done

    for repeat in {0..9}
    do
        for fold in {0..9}
        do
	    python setupCV_computeNetworks.py data/SamSpecCoEN/ACES data/SamSpecCoEN/outputs/U133A_combat_RFS/subtype_stratified ${fold} ${repeat}
        done
    done
```
This process can easily be parallelized.

**Warning** Note that for one repeat and fold, the networks take about 450 Mo of space, meaning that for 10 folds, 10 repeats, you need 43 Go of space to store the data. 

### Networks in a sampled leave-one-study-out cross-validation setting
We use a sampled leave-one-study-out cross-validation setting similar to that described in [Allahyar & de Ridder, 2015].

To create the corresponding data folds and networks:
```
    for repeat in {0..9}
    do
        python setupSampledLOSO_writeIndices.py data/SamSpecCoEN ${repeat}
    done

    for repeat in {0..9}
    do
        for fold in {0..9}
        do
	    python setupCV_computeNetworks.py data/SamSpecCoEN/ACES data/SamSpecCoEN/outputs/U133A_combat_RFS/sampled_loso  ${fold} ${repeat}
        done
    done
```
This process can easily be parallelized.

**Warning** Note that for one repeat and fold, the networks take about 450 Mo of space, meaning that for 10 folds, 10 repeats, you need 43 Go of space to store the data. 

Cross-validation experiments
----------------------------
The class for running a cross-validation experiment is `OuterCrossVal.py`. Internally, it uses `InnerCrossVal.py` to determine the best hyperparameters for the learning algorithm.

```python OuterCrossVal.py outputs/U133A_combat_DMFS lioness -o 5 -k 5 -m 400``` 
runs a 5-fold cross-validation experiment on the data stored in folds under `outputs/U133A_combat_DMFS`, for the LIONESS edge weights, using a 5-fold inner cross-validation loop, and returning at most 400 genes (following ACES/FERAL), for (for now) an L1-regularized logistic regression.

### Subtype-stratified cross-validation 
#### Parallelization at the repeat level
To run a cross-validation with 5-fold of inner cross-validation (for parameter setting), returning at most 1000 features:
```
data_dir=data/SamSpecCoEN/outputs/U133A_combat_RFS/subtype_stratified
aces_dir=data/SamSpecCoEN/ACES # downloaded from http://ccb.nki.nl/software/aces/

for repeat in {0..9}
do
    for network in lioness regline
    do
        python OuterCrossVal.py ${aces_dir} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat} ${network} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat}/results/${network} -o 10 -k 5 -m 1000
    done
done
```

The ```--nodes``` option allows you to run the exact same algorithm on the exact same folds, but using the node weights (i.e. gene expression data) directly instead of the edge weights, for comparison purposes (the network type is required but won't be used):

```
        python OuterCrossVal.py ${aces_dir} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat} lioness ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat}/results -o 10 -k 5 -m 1000 --nodes
```

#### Parallelization at the repeat/fold level
To run a cross-validation with 5-fold of inner cross-validation (for parameter setting), returning at most 1000 features:
```
data_dir=data/SamSpecCoEN/outputs/U133A_combat_RFS/subtype_stratified
aces_dir=data/SamSpecCoEN/ACES # downloaded from http://ccb.nki.nl/software/aces/
for repeat in {0..9}
do
    for fold in {0..9}
    do
        for network in lioness regline
        do
            python InnerCrossVal.py ${aces_dir} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat}/fold${fold} ${network} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat}/results/${network}/fold${fold} -k 5 -m 1000
        done
    done
done
```
Followed by
```
data_dir=data/SamSpecCoEN/outputs/U133A_combat_RFS/subtype_stratified
aces_dir=data/SamSpecCoEN/ACES # downloaded from http://ccb.nki.nl/software/aces/

for repeat in {0..9}
do
    for network in lioness regline
    do
        python run_OuterCrossVal.py ${aces_dir} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat} ${network} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat}/results/${network} -o 10 -k 5 -m 1000
    done
done
```

```
        python InnerCrossVal.py ${aces_dir} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat}/fold${fold} lioness ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat}/results/fold${fold} -k 5 -m 1000 --nodes
        
        python run_OuterCrossVal.py ${aces_dir} ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat} lioness ${data_dir}/repeat${repeat}/results/ -o 10 -k 5 -m 1000        
```
