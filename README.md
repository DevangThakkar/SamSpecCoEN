Build sample-specific co-expression networks.


Overview
========
The goal of this code is to build sample-specific co-expression networks: 
All samples have the same network *structure*, but edge weights depend on the sample.
The co-expression networks are built from Pearson's correlation between gene expressions.
Each individual weights reflects the sample's contribution/deviation from this population-wide correlation.

The two options are:  
1. LIONESS [Kuijjer et al., 2015]: For a given sample, an edge-weight is the contribution of this sample to the global correlation.  
1. For a given sample, the edge-weight is the distance of that sample to the regression line fitting the expression of both genes. This quantifies how much this sample deviates from the population-wide behaviour.  

We also use ideas from [Zhang and Horvath, 2005] to build the global (population-wide) network, i.e. that a co-expression network should be approximately scale-free.  

This code is meant to be used on the ACES gene expression data [Staiger et al., 2013].
